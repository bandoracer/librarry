# Architecture

Librarry is split into a Go backend, a React frontend, and Postgres.

## Backend

The backend owns provider credentials, metadata normalization, provider health,
matching policy, acquisition workers, and Postgres persistence. Provider tokens
never need to be exposed to the browser.

## Metadata Model

The data model separates conceptual works from concrete editions. This is the
main durability choice: a single book can have many ebook, audiobook, print, and
translated editions.

Manual overrides are stored separately and should always win over provider data.
Provider records keep raw provenance so future reconciliation can explain where
data came from and why a match was accepted or sent to review.

## Acquisition

Librarry integrates directly with Prowlarr, qBittorrent, and SABnzbd. Prowlarr
is queried for book releases through `/api/v1/releases/search`; the
Readarr-compatible `/api/v1/release` endpoint maps the same acquisition flow
into interactive release-search and grab payloads. Torrent releases are sent to
qBittorrent, while Usenet/NZB releases are sent to SABnzbd through the same
`/api/v1/grabs` API. Startup and `/api/v1/integrations/bootstrap` ensure the
book categories exist in qBittorrent.

Download state is reconciled from qBittorrent and SABnzbd through
`/api/v1/downloads` and stored in Postgres when database persistence is
configured. Torrent actions are exposed through `/api/v1/downloads/actions` for
start, stop, delete, recheck, priority changes, category changes, and location
changes. qBittorrent details are exposed through `/api/v1/downloads/{id}` with
properties, tracker state, and torrent file lists. Per-file qBittorrent priority
changes are exposed through `/api/v1/downloads/{id}/files/actions` for
skip/normal/high/max file selection. `/api/v1/downloads/rebalance` adds a simple
active-download limiter that can preview or apply start/stop operations against
the visible Librarry queue. SABnzbd actions currently support start, stop, and
delete. The API accepts multiple download IDs for these actions, routes each ID
back to its owning client when possible, and the web UI exposes selected-row bulk
controls for the common queue operations.

Failed-download recovery can be triggered manually through
`POST /api/v1/downloads/recover-failed` and can also run on an interval in the
API process. Recovery detects qBittorrent error/missing-file states and stale
stalled downloads with no seeders, reopens the linked wanted item, records the
failure on the download row, searches for replacement releases, and optionally
grabs the best approved replacement. Scheduled recovery defaults to search-only;
auto-grab and failed-torrent removal are explicit settings.

Readarr-compatible `/api/v1/blocklist` and legacy `/api/v1/blacklist` endpoints
are populated from failed active downloads plus failed Librarry history events.
The delete endpoints currently acknowledge compatibility clear requests; durable
blocklist editing still needs a dedicated persisted blocklist model.

Common Arr resource endpoints are exposed for quality definitions, language
profiles, metadata profiles, tags, custom formats, restrictions, notifications,
import lists, and remote path mappings. These endpoints currently provide
static defaults or echo create/update payloads in the expected API shape. The
persisted source of truth still lives in Librarry's native settings, quality
profiles, and integration configuration until each compatibility resource gets a
dedicated storage model.

Compatibility config endpoints for host, UI, download-client, and indexer
settings mirror current Librarry environment/native config and echo update
payloads for API callers. Delay profiles and system tasks are exposed in the
same compatibility layer; tasks are derived from Librarry scheduler intervals
for feed sync, missing-book monitoring, author refresh, failed-download
recovery, and upgrade search.

Wanted items are stored in Postgres from normalized metadata results. A wanted
item can search releases through Prowlarr, persist scored release decisions, and
record explicit rejection reasons before a candidate is sent to the matching
download client.

Quality profiles are stored in Postgres and applied anywhere a release is
evaluated: manual wanted search, scheduled monitoring, feed sync, failed
download replacement search, and upgrade search. Profiles currently control
minimum approval score, upgrade cutoff score, minimum torrent seeders, maximum
size, preferred terms, required terms, rejected terms, and whether upgrade
search is allowed.

The wanted monitor can be triggered manually through
`POST /api/v1/wanted/monitor` and can also run on an interval in the API process.
It selects due wanted items, reuses the same release evaluator as manual search,
records monitor run summaries, writes history events, and optionally sends the
best approved release to the matching download client when
`LIBRARRY_MONITOR_AUTO_GRAB=true`.

Author subscriptions are stored separately from wanted items. A subscription
captures provider provenance, author identity, target format, and quality
profile. The author monitor can be triggered manually through
`POST /api/v1/authors/monitor` and can also run on an interval in the API
process. It searches metadata providers for due authors, creates or refreshes
wanted items for matching books, records sync history, and does not grab
releases directly.

Upgrade search can be triggered manually through `POST /api/v1/wanted/upgrades`
and can also run on an interval in the API process. It searches grabbed/imported
wanted items, compares approved releases against the current grabbed release
score, and records upgrade candidates only when the item is below its profile
cutoff and the candidate improves by the configured minimum delta. Upgrade
search defaults to search-only; auto-grab is an explicit setting.

Feed sync can be triggered manually through `POST /api/v1/wanted/feed-sync` and
can also run on an interval in the API process. Prowlarr does not provide a
single aggregate RSS endpoint, so Librarry lists RSS-enabled Prowlarr indexers,
pulls each Prowlarr-compatible Torznab/Newznab feed, stores seen releases, and
matches feed entries against wanted items with the same release evaluator used by
manual search. Feed sync defaults to search-only and only sends approved
releases to the matching download client when
`LIBRARRY_FEED_SYNC_AUTO_GRAB=true` or a manual request sets `autoGrab`.

## Library Import

Library scanning walks the configured ebook and audiobook roots, classifies
supported file extensions, stores file records in Postgres, and keeps a
fingerprint in file metadata for later reconciliation. Manual import accepts a
source file path, optionally ties it to a wanted item, and copies or moves the
file into a sanitized path below the format root. The default naming policy is
`Author/Title/Title.ext`; deployments can change the author folder, book folder,
file name, and space replacement templates.

The Readarr-compatible `/api/v1/manualimport` surface maps to the same import
engine. `GET /api/v1/manualimport` lists pending import reviews, can scan a
provided folder for supported ebook/audiobook candidates, and `POST
/api/v1/manualimport` imports selected files through the regular library import
path. The naming and media-management compatibility config endpoints reflect
the active Librarry roots and naming templates; persisted Readarr-style config
writes are still future work.

Readarr-compatible calendar, history, and parse endpoints are derived from
wanted items, Librarry history events, and title parsing. The web UI keeps using
the native `/api/v1/librarry/history` event feed so external Arr clients can use
the Readarr-shaped `/api/v1/history` response.

Completed-download import refreshes Librarry-tagged qBittorrent items, filters
for completed torrents, locates the best supported ebook or audiobook file below
the torrent save path, imports linked wanted downloads, and records
imported/error state on the download row. Completed downloads without a wanted
tag are persisted as pending import reviews instead of being guessed directly
into the library. Review decisions can import, skip, or reject the pending file.

The implemented import path is intentionally conservative: it avoids overwriting
existing files and marks wanted items imported only after the destination file is
persisted. Future work should add OPF, EPUB, audio-tag extraction, richer
matching evidence, conflict policies, and bulk review flows.
